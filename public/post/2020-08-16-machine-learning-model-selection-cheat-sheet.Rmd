# Model Selection.


* But the time consumed for creating for all these models can cause real problems, in order to solve these thing and more or less to find a well suitable model. SKlean has a cheet sheet that saves a lot time in selecting a model.

* from the below diagram you can see the various constaints for selection a model on basic of dataset.

* This is a series of post where we will be trying various machine leaernig models, first on the next we will be learning how to approach a machine learning a problem.


# Thank You.
