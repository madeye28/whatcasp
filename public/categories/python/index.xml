      <description>How To Approach A Machine Learning ModelThis is just a short one , about how we are going to proceed in future posts. In this post we will be looking how we can proceed any machine learning model, form our previous post we can select a model appropriate to data we have.
Once the model is selected, we should approch the model in following way.
From the above image we can see the step by step we will be following in the upcoming posts, we will be expaining all the steps in details in Python.</description>

      <description>Model Selection.But the time consumed for creating for all these models can cause real problems, in order to solve these thing and more or less to find a well suitable model. SKlean has a cheet sheet that saves a lot time in selecting a model.
from the below diagram you can see the various constaints for selection a model on basic of dataset.
This is a series of post where we will be trying various machine leaernig models, first on the next we will be learning how to approach a machine learning a problem.</description>
