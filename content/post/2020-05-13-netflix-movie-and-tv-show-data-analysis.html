<p>Rating Abbrevations</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TV-MA</strong> :- This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17.</li>
<li><strong>TV-14</strong> :- This program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age</li>
<li><strong>TV-PG</strong> :- This program contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> :- Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Contains some adult material. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking their young children with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that clearly see that majority of Netflix is rated under this four category. <strong>TV-MA</strong> and <em>R</em> rating alone contributes to <strong>40%</strong>. Hence it shows that <strong>40% Movies and TV Shows</strong> are not suitable for Childrens Under 17.</p>
<p>That means, <strong>4 in 10 Movies or TV Shows</strong> is not suitable for childrens.</p>
<p>Yes! We are at the end. Netflix has been a great place for entertainment for people all over the World and it will keep on entertaining us.</p>
