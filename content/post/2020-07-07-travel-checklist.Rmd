## Why one should travel ?







*“It is better to travel well than to arrive.”*

*“A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”*

*“Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.”*

*“Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.”*

*“Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.”*

*“Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s OK. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.”*

*“To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world.”*
