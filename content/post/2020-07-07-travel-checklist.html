<div id="why-one-should-travel" class="section level2">
<h2>Why one should travel ?</h2>
<p><em>“It is better to travel well than to arrive.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s OK. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.”</em></p>
<p><em>“To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world.”</em></p>
<p>THE PLACES I HAVE VISITED AND YET TO VISIT</p>
